### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Fullstack Software, and AI Engineer**. I focus on architecting data-driven software that solve domain specific problems in complex data-oriented environments and specific user cases in financial services, and retail. Currently, I am a Senior Software Engineer with Accenture UK, and prior to that, I lead a Solutions Development team at KPMG, where I focused on developing and maintaining scalable analytics software solutions some of which includes KPMG's ATM Reconciliation Application for Banks.
