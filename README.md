### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Fullstack Software, and ML/AI Solutions Developer**. I focus on architecting data-driven software that solve domain specific problems in complex data-oriented environments (i.e. Financial Services Sector and Consumer Markets). I currently lead an analytics solutions development team at KPMG Nigeria, focused on developing and maintaining scalable analytics solutions for clients. Some of my most recent work at KPMG Nigeria include: ATM Reconciliation Application for Banks
